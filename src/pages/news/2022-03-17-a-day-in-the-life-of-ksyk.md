What does a normal Monday look like in KSYK? Let’s see what the students have been up to…****

Most students are apparently trying to absorb some light through their phones…

The atmosphere among seniors was both wistful and happy. The amazing snowy scenery was also a factor in making the seniors enjoy their day even more.

There might be a spy among you… a rare photo of the insights of abilounge, which has now closed down. Stay tuned for the abishow to see what the lounge’s funeral looked like.

(drum roll, please) to have GREAT SNACKS! And oh, just a reminder for all those who are taking part in the matriculation examinations this spring: snacks are the most important part. They make the experience a little more tolerable.

Please do it more! Be brave!

It is easy to run to your next lesson from there after relaxing on the sofas with some friends. Study hall can get especially loud during afternoons when students get tired again.
